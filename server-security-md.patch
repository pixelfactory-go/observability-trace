 ## Reporting a Vulnerability
 
-If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:
+We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. To report a vulnerability, please use one of the following secure methods:
 
 **Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**
 
-### How to Report
+### Reporting Methods
 
-1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/pixelfactory-go/version/security/advisories/new) feature to privately report the vulnerability.
+1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/pixelfactory-go/server/security/advisories/new) feature to privately report vulnerabilities
+2. **Email**: Send details to security@pixelfactory.io with "[SECURITY]" in the subject line
 
-2. **Email**: If you prefer email, please contact the maintainers through the repository contact information.
+### What Constitutes a Vulnerability
 
-### What to Include
+A vulnerability is a weakness in the software that could be exploited to:
+- Execute arbitrary code or commands
+- Bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms
+- Access sensitive data or credentials
+- Cause denial of service or system crashes
+- Inject malicious content
+- Compromise the integrity of server operations
 
-When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
+### What to Include in Your Report
 
-- A description of the vulnerability
-- Steps to reproduce the issue
-- Potential impact
-- Any suggested fixes (if available)
+When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:
+- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
+- Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
+- Affected versions
+- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots
+- Potential impact assessment
+- Suggested fixes or mitigations (if available)
 
-### Response Timeline
+## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure
 
-- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
-- We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
-- We will work on a fix and keep you informed of our progress
-- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate disclosure timing with you
+We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices to ensure vulnerabilities are handled responsibly:
 
-## Security Best Practices
+### Our Disclosure Timeline
 
-When using this library:
+1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
+2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment and severity rating within 5 business days
+3. **Disclosure Coordination**: We request a disclosure embargo of at least 90 days from the initial report to allow time for:
+   - Thorough investigation and validation
+   - Development and testing of fixes
+   - Preparation of security patches and advisories
+   - Coordination with downstream users and distributors
+4. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability within 7 days, or coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
 
-- Always use the latest stable version
-- Review release notes and changelogs for security updates
-- Follow semantic versioning practices in your build process
-- Validate version strings before displaying them to users
+### Disclosure Process
+
+- We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
+- We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the remediation process
+- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
+- If a vulnerability is already publicly known or being actively exploited, we may expedite the disclosure timeline to 30 days or less
+
+### Expectations
+
+- **Confidentiality**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have released a fix and agreed upon a disclosure date
+- **Good Faith**: We expect security researchers to act in good faith and avoid actions that could harm users, such as accessing unnecessary data, degrading service, or destroying data
+- **No Legal Action**: We will not pursue legal action against researchers who discover and report vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy
 
 ## Security Update Process
 
-Security fixes will be:
+When a vulnerability is confirmed:
+
+1. We will develop and test a security patch
+2. We will release the patch in a new version
+3. We will publish a security advisory with:
+   - Description of the vulnerability
+   - Affected versions
+   - Fixed versions
+   - Workarounds (if available)
+   - Credit to the reporter
+4. We will notify users through GitHub security advisories and release notes
+
+## Scope
+
+This security policy applies to:
+- The server library and all its components
+- Official documentation and examples
+- Build and release infrastructure
+
+Out of scope:
+- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report to the respective projects)
+- Vulnerabilities in applications using this library (unless the root cause is in the library itself)
+
+## Contact
 
-1. Developed in a private branch
-2. Released as soon as possible after validation
-3. Announced through GitHub Security Advisories
-4. Documented in the CHANGELOG
+For security-related questions or concerns:
+- **Security Email**: security@pixelfactory.io
+- **GitHub**: https://github.com/pixelfactory-go/server/security/advisories
